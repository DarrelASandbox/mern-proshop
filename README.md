> <b>Mehdi: </b>Why duplicate data in orderModel?
>
> at 09:52 in "Modeling Our Data". Why the orderModel has a field called orderItems with (name, price...) while we already have that data in the productModel. Why not just have an array ids of products in orderModel?

> <b>Leonidas: </b>I guess you could go that way as well. The you would have smaller documents in the db, but whenever you needed that data you would need to populate from the productModel with the related id and this would require extra logic implemented and more roundtrips to fetch the data.

> <b>Niko: </b>The order items and shop products are two different entities and it's important to differentiate between them. The order item usually contains a reference to the product, but also copies of the important product properties at the time it was sold (name, price, tax class, etc). Otherwise when product data is changed (which is pretty common), you would also change all existing orders. Besides that - order items usually hold a lot of additional information that is specific to it's order (discounts, extras like gift wrapping, tax rates)

> "message": "Cannot read property 'password' of undefined", "stack": "TypeError: Cannot read property 'password' of undefined\n at model.userSchema.methods.matchPassword (file:///proshop/backend/models/userModel.js:31:53)\n at file:////proshop/backend/controllers/userController.js:11:27\n at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:97:5)" }

> <b>Bassir: </b>because "this" in the arrow function point to the parent object and there is no parent object or function there. so you need to use regular functions.

> <b>Dhruv: </b>Thanks, for the reply. Could u please explain how we have parent object in regular function but not in arrow function. By the way, The course is really helpful.

> <b>Zhing Jieh Jack: </b>In general, <code>this</code> is a special variable that points to either the globalObject (e.g window), caller (instance), or Class.
> For an instance's function, <code>this</code> points to the instance. Hence we can do <code>this.password</code> as <code>this</code> points to user instance.
> For a static function (Class's function), <code>this</code> points to the Class. Hence we can do <code>this.find({})</code> as <code>this</code> points to User model.
> For an arrow function, <code>this</code> does not point to the caller (instance) or its Class, it points to the context where the arrow function is called.
>
> [This MDN document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) should clarify more

> <b>David: </b>Arrow functions do not get hoisted and "this" is set to window object. Its just how they work. You have to bind "this" manually. It would be easier to just write it as a normal function in this case

> <b>Roy: </b>Possible security issue with /api/orders/:id
>
> While the order IDs are generated by Mongo and hard to guess, doesn't this endpoint pose a potential security/privacy issue? The only check is that the user is a valid, logged in user and not that the user is the one who placed the order. If I happen to know or guess someone's Order ID I could return all of their personal data from the order (name, email, address)

> <b>Bassir: </b>You can not guess the mongodb id because it is unique id. about have a check if user is admin or use is owner of the order I am with you. it's been noted.

> <b>Fraser: </b>I modified my getOrderById function to check if the request was from an admin or if the order user ID was equal to the request user ID:

```js
// @desc    Get order by ID
// @route   GET /api/orders/:id
// @access  Private
const getOrderById = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const order = await Order.findById(req.params.id).populate(
    'user',
    'name email'
  );

  if (order && (req.user.isAdmin || order.user._id.equals(req.user._id))) {
    res.json(order);
  } else {
    res.status(404);
    throw new Error('Order not found');
  }
});
```

> One would expect to be able to compare order.user.\_id === req.user.\_id but this didn't work. After some investigation I came across [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11060213/mongoose-objectid-comparisons-fail-inconsistently) which solved the problem.

> <b>Tamunoemi Benson: </b> Hi @roy you can check if users are the owner of the order by the below

```js
export const getOrderById = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const order = await Order.findById(req.params.id).populate(
    'user',
    'name email'
  );
  if (order && order.user._id.toString() !== req.user._id.toString()) {
    res.status(401);
    throw new Error('Unauthorized Action');
  } else if (order) {
    res.json(order);
  } else {
    res.status(404);
    throw new Error('No order found');
  }
});
```
